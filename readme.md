# Neat PC (stuff to organize your PC and you) [WIP]

Currently, this repository contains **simple scripts to install** some apps on **Windows** and **some notes, books, links etc for programmers**.

It's a similar idea with "awesome" repositories etc but with priority on "efficiency" *(perhaps, it's the word word isn't really suitable here)*.

* [Chocolatey scripts](/windows/chocolatey.md)
* [For programmers](/for_programmers.md)
